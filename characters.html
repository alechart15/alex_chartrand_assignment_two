Satoru regularly experiences a strange phenomenon he calls "revival" everytime a tragedy happens around him. This phenomena forces him back in time just moments before said tragedy and gives him the chance to stop it from happening. Though reluctantly, Satoru does his best to help the people he can, something that he often ends up paying for. Stoic and reserved, Satoru often puts up a facade of being more socially adept than he actually is.</p>

This, in turn, triggered Satoru's "Revival" which sent him 18 years back in time. Originally, Satoru was supposed to prevent the serial killer from noticing Sachiko's presence in the parking lot, where the first Revival of the day occurred, to prevent her death.</p>
